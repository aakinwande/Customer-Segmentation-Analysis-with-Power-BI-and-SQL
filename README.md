# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-with-Power-BI-and-SQL
This project leverages the combined capabilities of Power BI and SQL for in-depth customer segmentation analysis. The dataset used includes customer demographics, purchase behavior, satisfaction ratings, and more. SQL queries were employed to extract and transform data from the database into CSV files, which were then analyzed and visualized using Power BI. The goal is to derive actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and improve overall business performance.

1.Customer Demographic Segmentation: Analyze customer age and gender demographics contributing to sales.<br />
2.Geographical Trends: Identify regions generating the highest sales and customer engagement.<br />
3.Seasonal Purchasing Behavior: Understand seasonal variations in customer buying patterns.<br />
4.Product Category Preferences: Determine popular product categories and their contribution to revenue.<br />
5.High-Value Customers: Identify top-spending customers and their purchasing behavior.<br />
6.Customer Satisfaction: Evaluate customer satisfaction ratings across different product categories.<br />
7.Subscription Impact: Assess the influence of subscription services on customer purchasing habits.<br />
8.Shipping and Payment Preferences: Analyze preferred shipping methods and payment options among customers.
